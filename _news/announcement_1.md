But that probably wasn't news to you, since you're reading this. I'll outline what I plan to use this website for.

---

<h3>Organization</h3>
I find that my performance improves when I have a minimal, customized, and organized space for my work. Although I'm not the type of person to use Notion, I care enough about organization to have a custom website to fit my needs.


<h3>Blog</h3>
I plan to post periodically about whatever topics come to mind at the moment. These posts may vary in quality, since this is my first time blogging after all. The idea is for me years to look back at these posts and get an idea of what exactly past me was thinking (an ability I wish I had right now).

<h3>Projects</h3>
I'll be hosting some frontend projects on Github Pages, and this site can hopefully create some advertisement for those projects (check out the Projects tab btw).

<h3>Work</h3>
Man's gotta make money. Plus, I don't like the LinkedIn layout, since it's a bit too rigid for me. Having greater SEO also helps with my search for employment.

I'm not too sure what should go on a personal website, but I gotta start somewhere. After all,

Though, to be optimistic, I would also add, "everything can come of anything."
