Greetings, dear reader!

I'm Kevin, a native Chicagoan and a undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science with plans to do a machine learning concentration. I also have  interests all over the place (both academic and non-academic) which I talk about in my blog posts.

Some fun facts about me are that I'm a minimalist, a determinist, my favorite season is winter, I really like food (and researching food), and I'm always thinking about something.

Feel free to reach out to me at kz3@andrew.cmu.edu or at any of the socials linked below. I'd love to chat and connect with you!
